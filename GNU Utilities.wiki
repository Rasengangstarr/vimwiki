Here are a list of some basic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU|GNU]] commands.

== grep ==

=== Synopsis ===
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

=== Description ===
       grep  searches  for  PATTERNS  in  each  FILE.  PATTERNS is one or
       patterns separated by newline characters,  and  grep  prints  each
       line that matches a pattern.

       A  FILE  of  “-”  stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given,
       recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive
       searches read standard input.

       In  addition, the variant programs egrep and fgrep are the same as
       grep -E and grep -F, respectively.  These variants are deprecated,
       but are provided for backward compatibility.

=== Examples ===

* *grep -irn 'my string'* will search for 'my string' case insensitively (i) and recursively (r), and will output the line number of each match
* *grep -Eiw 'hello|world'* will search for the whole words hello *or* world.
