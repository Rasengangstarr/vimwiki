=tectonics=

This project was initially at attempt to model plate tectonics. I didn't quite get there, but learnt alot on the road.

==iterations==

=== 1 - solid heat dissipation ===

At first I attempted to use a solid, 2d array to simulate convection.
I wasn't able to make it work, since although i could get the heat dissipation to work according to [[https://www.thermal-engineering.org/what-is-fouriers-law-of-thermal-conduction-definition/|fourier's law]], there seems to be no way of making the heat 'split' from left to right at the top.

I will insert an image here showing what i ended up with.

=== 2 - particle based boiling simulation ===
