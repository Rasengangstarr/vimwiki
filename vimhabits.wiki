= vimhabits =

In order to teach myself some vimscript, i would like to make some kind of marked-up habit tracker for vim. I would also like to integrate this with vimwiki, possibly utilizing the diary features for easy entering of habits.

For now, the script can be accessed only directly through my .vimrc, which can be found [[https://github.com/Rasengangstarr/baserc/blob/master/.vimrc|here]]

== MVP ==

=== syntax ===

The user can enter something like the following:

/vimhabits[5]
	eat a sandwhich
	drink some water
	go for a run
	pet the cat
vimhabits/

Which will be replaced with this output:

| Day | eat a sandwhich | drink some water | go for a run | pet the cat | 
| 1   |                 |                  |              |             |
| 2   |                 |                  |              |             |
| 3   |                 |                  |              |             |
| 4   |                 |                  |              |             |
| 5   |                 |                  |              |             |

== Todo ==

- [ ] Handle no vimhabits in document
- [ ] Handle multiple vimhabits in document
- [ ] Create vimdiary integration
