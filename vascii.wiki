I want to be able to have 'images' in my vim wiki pages. I will attempt to convert images to ascii using command line tools and paste them into documents.

I have chosen to try the jp2a tool first, as it is available on pacman.

== prerequisites ==
You will first need to install jp2a. You can find instructions on how to do this for your distribution
[[://ostechnix.com/how-to-convert-images-into-ascii-format-in-linux/|here]].


== usage ==

Place your cursor over the tags below and press C-j (control + j)
